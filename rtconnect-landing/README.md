## <a name="what"/> What is RTConnect?

RTConnect is an easy-to-use npm package and React component library that enables developers to establish live, real-time peer to peer video communication in an existing React codebase. 

RTConnect streamlines and simplifies the implementation of WebRTC for developers by providing a React component and signaling server module that operates using Websockets for the backend.
