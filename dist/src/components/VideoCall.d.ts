/**
 * @func VideoCall
 * @param {String} props.URL - ws or wss link that establishes a connection between the WebSocket object and the server
 * @param {object} props.mediaOptions video embed attributes
 
 * @desc Wrapper component containing the logic necessary for peer connections using WebRTC APIs (RTCPeerConnect API + MediaSession API) and WebSockets.
 *
 * ws, localVideo, remoteVideo, peerRef, localStream, otherUser, senders are all mutable ref objects that are created using the useRef hook. The useRef hook allows you to persist values between renders and it is used to store a mutable value that does NOT cause a re-render when updated.
 *
 * The WebSocket connection (ws.current) is established using the useEffect hook and once the component mounts, the Socket component is rendered. The Socket component adds event listeners that handle the offer-answer model and the exchange of SDP objects between peers and the socket.
 *
 * The WebSocket message event will filter through various events to determine the payloads that will be sent to other serverside socket connection via WebSocket.
 *
 * @type {state} username - username state stores the name the client enters. All users (see getUsers) will be able to see an updated list of all other users whenever a new user logs in or leaves.
 * @type {state} users - users state is the list of connected users that is rendered on the frontend.
 *
 * @returns A component that renders two VideoComponents,
