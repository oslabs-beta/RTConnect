# RTConnect

RTConnect is an easy-to-use React component library that enables developers to set up live, real-time video calls, chats, and filesharing between multiple connected peers in a React app. RTConnect achieves these features within the functional scope of React components by simplifying the implementation of WebRTC and Websockets to establish real-time communications for developers.
