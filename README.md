# RTConnect

RTConnect is an easy-to-use React component library that enables developers to set up live, real-time video calls, chats, and filesharing between multiple connected peers in a React app. RTConnect achieves these features within the functional scope of React components by simplifying the implementation of WebRTC and Websockets to establish real-time communications for developers. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156403/178079169-a69a8019-2fc8-4d6f-9f18-d236a2a060cd.png)
