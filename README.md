# RTConnect

RTConnect is an easy-to-use React component library that enables developers to set up live, real-time video calls, between multiple connected peers on different computers in a React app. RTConnect achieves these features within the functional scope of React components by simplifying the implementation of WebRTC and Websockets to establish low latency, real-time communications for developers.

# Installation

```
npm install rtconnect
```
After installing the rtconnect npm package, import the VideoComponent component in your React file:

```
import { Rtconnect } from ‘rtconnect’;
```

Then use the RTConnect component as you would any other React component and include your URL.

```
<Rtconnect URL={'localhost:PORT'}>
```
For example, if your server is hosted on port 3000, then you would do the following:
```
<Rtconnect URL={'localhost:3000'}>
```
