# RTConnect

RTConnect is an easy-to-use React component library that enables developers to set up live, real-time video calls, between multiple connected peers on different computers in a React app. 

RTConnect achieves these features within the functional scope of React components by simplifying the implementation of WebRTC and Websockets to establish low latency, real-time communications for developers.

# Installation

```
npm install rtconnect
```
After installing the rtconnect npm package, import the Rtconnect component in your React file:

## <a name="what"/> What is RTConnect?

RTConnect is an easy-to-use npm package and React component library that enables developers to establish live, real-time peer to peer video communication in an existing React codebase. 

RTConnect streamlines and simplifies the implementation of WebRTC for developers by providing a React component and signaling server module that operates using Websockets for the backend. 

## <a name="install"/> Install RTConnect
```
npm install rtconnect
```

 ## <a name="implementation"/> Implementation
 After installing the rtconnect npm package, import the VideoComponent component in your React file:

Then use the RTConnect component as you would any other React component and include your URL.

```
<Rtconnect URL={'localhost:PORT'}>
```

For example, if your server is hosted on port 3000, then you would do the following:

```
<Rtconnect URL={'localhost:PORT'}>
```
For example, if your server is hosted on port 3000, then you would do the following:

```
<Rtconnect URL={'localhost:3000'}>
```
